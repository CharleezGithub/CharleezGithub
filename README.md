"""

It's real simple
You got two more quarters and thats it
And most of you have been playing this game for ten years
You got two more quarters
And after that most of you will never play this game again, long as you live
I want you to take a moment
And I want you to look each other in the eyes
I want you to put each other in your hearts forever
Because forever is about to happen here in just a few minutes
